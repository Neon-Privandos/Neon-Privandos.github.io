			<h2>The relationship between Astrology and Religion</h2>

			<p id="p1">No, astrology isn‚Äôt a religion, it is a pseudoscience that aims to explain occurrences in life through the movement and positioning of heavenly bodies. Astrology is often referenced in the Bible, yet Christians are discouraged to use astrology as their basis of belief. Astrology is not merely limited to psychics, fortune telling, and determining fate. Astrology practitioners do not base their findings on intuition alone, they also apply mathematics and certain scientific laws to their work. There are multiple misconceptions of astrology present in the Bible, and in truth, astrology actually has nothing to do with religion.</p>
			<h2>The relationship between Astrology and Science</h2>
			<hr>
			<img src="images/csm.png" width=150px height=150px alt="Religion, Science">
			<p id="p1">Astrology isn‚Äôt considered as a real science since it isn‚Äôt backed up by the laws and logic of proven scientific facts. Instead, it is classified as a pseudoscience, but the findings in this study of life have actually helped in other scientific fields such as Astronomy, Meteorology, Medicine and Alchemy. Many people still argue as to whether astrology is a real science or not because astrology incorporates scientific knowledge about the planets, stars, and the heavens. Although it also utilizes actual proven science it is still combined with superstitions and baseless predictions. </p>
